## Implement a CUDA program that computes the dot product of two vectors containing 32-bit floating point numbers
The dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of two vectors.
Mathematically, the dot product of two vectors **A** and **B** of length *n* is defined as:

$$A \cdot B = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} A_i \cdot B_i = A_0 \cdot B_0 + A_1 \cdot B_1 + \dots + A_{n-1} \cdot B_{n-1}$$

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only CUDA native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

def torch_solve(A: torch.Tensor, B: torch.Tensor, result: torch.Tensor, N: int):
    result.copy_(torch.dot(A, B))

# a, b, result are tensors on the GPU
def solve(a: torch.Tensor, b: torch.Tensor, result: torch.Tensor, n: int):
    pass
